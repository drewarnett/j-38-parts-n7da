## [shorting knob](<shorting knob>)

Shorting bar knob with tap sized hole for 8-32.  To use:

1.  Print.
2.  Cut threads with 8-32 tap.
3.  Get a piece of 8-32 threaded rod of the right length.  (I cut from a 1/2
    inch screw and cleaned the burrs with a file.)
4.  Thread the rod into the knob.
5.  Install this replacement knob.
